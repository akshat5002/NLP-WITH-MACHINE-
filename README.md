predictions based on the strategic  performance of students

First, we check the student data against the hours worked. After that, we process all the preprocessing steps. We then split the data into training and testing sets according to our requirements. Next, we create a new model using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, to determine its accuracy. Finally, we test the model and evaluate its performance, comparing the results of the untrained model with those of the trained model.
